Data Source Attribution
---------------------------

The raw data utilized to make the tidy data set presented here represent data collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope signals from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description and attribution is available at the site where the data was originally obtained:

[http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

The specific zipped file containing the raw data set for this project was provided by the class instructors.



Details
---------
There were 30 individual subjects in the test. They are represented by the arbitrary values of numbers one through thirty as identifying indicators (`subject ids`).

Accelerometer and gyroscope readings were analyzed for six types of activities: 
- walking
- walking_upstairs
- walking_downstairs
- sitting
- standing
- laying


The means and standard deviations for 66 measures have been averaged over time for each test subject. Specifically,my handling of the original data resulted in only collecting the measures of `mean()` and `std()` for each measure and required the measure have both. Some measures that included the term `mean` were not included here as a result because the derived data set described here is only dealing with the means and accompanying standard deviations of the assessements of the measures.


The sixty-six measures for which the averages for each test subject and activity analyzed are featured in the data set:

A data.table named `tidy` is set with the following columns.  All units are maintained from the original data set. A file named tidy.txt is written from run_analysis.R.

The names were based on information in the following files from the original data set:
- `features.txt` 
- `features_info.txt` and 
- `README.txt` 




Transformations and fixes
--------------------------
The provided training and testing data sets were merged to create a single combined data set. For further work, I limited the data set to only include data related to mean or standard deviation values (denoted by the presence of `mean()` or `std()` in the feature names) as described above.  

The averages of the means and standard deviations for each activity for each individual test subject were calculated and are presented in the tidy data set `tidy_data_of_means.txt`.

####Details of fixes addressed
While there weren't many mistakes that I saw. One fixed in the course of making the variable names of the measures better involved the variable names. For example, the `features_info.txt` file listed that there should be `fBodyAccJerkMag` but that doesn't occur in the original provided features listing in `features.txt`. Instead there is `fBodyBodyAccJerkMag`  in `features.txt`. Likewise, a similar phenomena occurs for several of the last variable names listed towards the end of the list of variable names in `features.txt`. (The list itself encompasses lines 13 to 29 of that file.)
  


Accessing the data set 
------------------------
The tidy data set produced should be downloadable via the link provided by Coursera.
After downloading, the tidy data set can be read in by 

    data_read <- read.table("tidy_data_of_means.txt")
    
However, when the whitespaces I had in my varaible names gets converted to periods, or at least show up as such when the table `data_read` is viewed in rStudio. However, if you view the `tidy_data_of_means.txt` separately in a text editor, you'll see the spaces.
